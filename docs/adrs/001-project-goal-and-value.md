# ADR 001: Project Goal and Value

**Date:** 2025-05-06  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

This project aims to implement a conference management system using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles, leveraging Red Hat's enterprise open source solutions as the implementation platform. We need to clearly define our project goals and the value it brings to establish a shared understanding among team members and stakeholders.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for a clear project vision and purpose
* Importance of understanding business value for prioritization decisions
* Desire to create a reference implementation of DDD and Hexagonal Architecture on Red Hat technologies
* Educational value for learning and applying DDD concepts with enterprise-grade open source solutions
* Alignment with Red Hat's hybrid cloud strategy for future scalability

## Decision Outcome

### Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive conference management system that demonstrates the practical application of Domain-Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture principles using Red Hat's enterprise open source platform. The system will handle attendee registration, session management, catering coordination, and swag distribution while showcasing the capabilities of Red Hat's container platform and development tools.

### Business Value
This project delivers value through:

1. **Educational Value**: Serves as a learning tool and reference implementation for developers interested in DDD and Hexagonal Architecture using Red Hat technologies.

2. **Efficiency**: Automates conference management processes, reducing manual work and potential for human error through robust enterprise-grade platform capabilities.

3. **Improved Attendee Experience**: Streamlines registration and provides personalized experiences through proper domain modeling.

4. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: The hexagonal architecture combined with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform allows for easy adaptation to changing business requirements and technology stacks.

5. **Domain Insights**: By focusing on the conference domain, we create a system that aligns closely with business needs and terminology.

6. **Enterprise Readiness**: Built on Red Hat's enterprise open source solutions, the system inherits security, reliability, and scalability features.

## Validation

The success of this project will be measured by:

* Completion of key domain features (attendee registration, session management, etc.)
* Clarity of domain boundaries and responsibilities
* Clean separation of concerns through hexagonal architecture
* Ability to explain DDD concepts using the project as a concrete example
* Ease of maintaining and extending the system over time
* Successful deployment on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Effective use of Red Hat's developer tools for improved development experience

## Notes

This project is based on concepts from:
* "Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans
* "Domain Driven Design Distilled" by Vaughn Vernon
* Red Hat's best practices for enterprise application development
